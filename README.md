# T_Clone
A twitter clone using Java, Spring Boot, PostgresSQL and React


## Day 1

1. Committed myself to the project.
2. Installed and set-up Git.
3. Setting up the environment.
4. Installed Java, PostgreSQL, Eclipse and STS Plugin for Eclipse.

### * Note: *
> Although STS 4 plugin for Eclipse is said to be full of bugs, it is the only one that was able to install properly. STS 3 threw errors which I was not able to solve even after hours of troubleshooting, reinstalling and scratching my head.

I could have used MySQL but the online community preferred me to use PostgreSQL as it is free and commmunity friendly. (Learning it from scratch!)

Haven't set up React as I don't know anything about it. Learning it for the time being.


## Day 2

1. Fix PostgreSQL connection and privilege issues
2. Create Role class to manage role privileges
3. Create user class to manage user data

## Day 3

1. Set up repos
2. Test them for data addition
